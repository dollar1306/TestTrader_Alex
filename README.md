Selenium C#///A program for checking connection to the site with the entry of access information


Write a program in C# with your favorite IDE

1. Perform a login flow using selenium driver, with the given credentials to the site:

URL: https:take from excel

Username: take from excel

Password: take from excel


2. Write a function that can validate the site was loaded in less than 10 seconds, in case it didnâ€™t
throw a proper exception.

3. After login, write a flow that will logout from the site and extract the text that popup after you
hover on the question mark.
- save the text to an external file of your choice.

Main points to consider:
- Assume your test data come from excel/ properties file or any DB/Data Type
- Project structure, error handling, log reports
